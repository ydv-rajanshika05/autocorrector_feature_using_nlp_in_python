# autocorrector_feature_using_nlp_in_python
Autocorrect is a way of predicting or making the wrong spellings correct, which makes the tasks like writing paragraphs, reports, and articles easier. Today there are a lot of Websites and Social media platforms that use this concept to make web apps user-friendly.

So, here we are using Machine Learning and NLP to make an autocorrection generator that will suggest to us the correct spellings for the input word. We will be using Python Programming Language for this.

Letâ€™s move ahead with the project.

We will be using NTLK Library for the implementation of NLP-related tasks.
